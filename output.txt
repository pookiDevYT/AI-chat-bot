code helper: Sure! Let's create a simple text-based game called "Guess the Number." Here's a basic version:

```python
import random

def guess_the_number():
    number_to_guess = random.randint(1, 100)
    attempts = 0

    print("Welcome to 'Guess the Number'!")
    print("I'm thinking of a number between 1 and 100.")

    while True:
        try:
            guess = int(input("Enter your guess: "))
            attempts += 1

            if guess < number_to_guess:
                print("Too low!")
            elif guess > number_to_guess:
                print("Too high!")
            else:
                print(f"Congratulations! You guessed the number {number_to_guess} in {attempts} attempts.")
                break
        except ValueError:
            print("Please enter a valid integer.")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    guess_the_number()
```

**How it works:**
1. The program generates a random number between 1 and 100.
2. It prompts the user to guess the number.
3. It checks if the guess is too high, too low, or correct.
4. It continues until the user guesses the number correctly, then it shows how many attempts it took.

You can run this script in any Python environment to play the game. Let me know if you want a different type of game or need further modifications!
